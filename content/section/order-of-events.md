## 1:00pm - Arrive and Check Into Rooms

Get settled for a bit, then meet up in the garden for a welcome mocktail and grab a couple snacks. 

## 2pm - Group Hike

We will be hiking though the beautiful Harmony Headlands.  The trailhead is an 8-10 minute drive from the motel.  The trail is mostly flat and meanders through a lovely nature preserve to some spectacular vistas of the Pacific Ocean.

## 4:00pm - Return to the Motel

Chill for a while! Hangout in the garden, walk down to the water, or check out some nearby shops. 


## 5:30 - Dinner at Duckies

Duckies is known for their Fish & Chips and Clam Chowder.  They also have chicken dishes, burgers, salads and veggie buritos.
